ADS Library
===========

.. highlight:: none

*By: Junjie Mao*

Goal
----

Set-up a private ADS library and to export bibliography items.


Preparation
-----------

Create an ADS account and sign in with your account.

Create a private library
------------------------
Here we create a new project named project_A.

   :width: 600

Now, you should have an empty library named project_A.

Add some references to the library
----------------------------------
Next, we search some references papers by specifying the full name of the first
author and the year of publication.

.. note:: Of course, there are other ways to find reference papers on ADS.

We also filter the initial results by limiting to refereed publications only.

Now, you should get only 4 results in total.

Select three of them and add them to the existing library project_A.

.. note:: If publications were already in the existing library, only the new
   ones will be added.

Export the references in the AASTeX format
------------------------------------------

.. note:: The `AASTeX <https://journals.aas.org/aastex-package-for-manuscript-preparation/>`_
   format is one of the formats provided by American Astronomical Society (AAS)
   assist authors in preparing manuscripts intended for submission to
   AAS-affiliated journals like the Astrophysical Journal (ApJ).
